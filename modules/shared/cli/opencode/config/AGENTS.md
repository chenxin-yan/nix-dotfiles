## API Documentation & Context Search

1. **Use context7 for documentation lookups** – Search context7 whenever you need to verify API specifications for libraries. Do not rely on memory or your general knowledge alone.

2. **No hallucination** – Never invent or assume API behavior, field names, or error codes. If documentation is unavailable, explicitly state this and request clarification from the user.

3. **Verify before implementation** – Always confirm API signatures and contract details from authoritative sources before writing code.

4. **Document mismatches** – If expected behavior differs from documented behavior, flag it clearly.
